I will change this to a change log currently its a project todo list.

To do...



/// Redux implementation of state and store, no more fetch data on each component please.

/// Only show account info if logged in

/// Sell item - show login if not logged in

/// Custom login page

/// Design and UX

// server side rendering
https://www.eventedmind.com/items/meteor-the-spiderable-package


Part done...

/// Custom url bespoke url to view the items details

/// CDN for images ( AWS? ) and send monogo the url (its only adding to the profile collection no permissions for the other collections, tried to allow update and still no luck)

/// Sell item needs to create a new item not just post to a database ( the meteor call is inside the slingshot to make it work needs to be moved)
